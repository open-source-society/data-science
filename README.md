## About

This is a path for those of you who want to complete the Data Science undergraduate curriculum on your own time, **for free**, with courses from the **best universities** in the World.

In our curriculum, we give preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) style courses because these courses were created with our style of learning in mind.

## Curricular Guideline

OSSU Data Science uses the report [Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Data Science](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/EDU-DataScienceGuidelines.pdf) as our guide for course recommendation.

## How to use this guide

### Order of the classes

Some courses can be taken in parallel, while others must be taken sequentially. All of the courses within a topic should be taken in the order listed in the curriculum. The graph below demonstrates how topics should be ordered.

![Topic Progression Graph](topic_progression_graph.jpg)

### Which programming languages should I use?

Python and R are heavily used in Data Science community and our courses teach you both. Remember, the important thing for each course is to internalize the core concepts and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

### Content Policy

You must share only files that you are allowed. **Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct** that you sign in the beginning of your courses.

## How to contribute
